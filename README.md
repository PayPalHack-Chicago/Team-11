FICY's Mission:
Inspired by a friend's struggle with familiarity of terminology, FICY aims to increase Financial Literacy in children and adults to get them to start thinking about money management.

How to get started:
On ficy.org, you can find different resources catered to different age groups and different ways to interact with the content. There are games for kids to engage with and various resources (FAQs, etc.) to make financial literacy less intimidating. People from all socio-economic backgrounds should be comfortable with understanding their control of money that reaches them (paycheck) and does not (taxes, insurance, etc.).
